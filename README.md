## About Me

My name is Marta, and I'm starting my journey into tech! During my Physics degree I discovered my passion for coding, and after a few years in academic Philosophy, I realised that my enthusiasm for creative problem solving and my talent to handle complexity align perfectly with a software engineering career.

My focus now is to work on exciting projects and continue to grow as a developer.

Here you can find some of my personal projects.

## Projects

- [The Guardian News App](https://github.com/contimarta/news-challenge) - Personal project where I built a React App that uses The Guardian API to retrieve the latest news and display them.
- [Kitchen Utensils Boutique](https://github.com/contimarta/boutique) - Pair-Programming project where we built a shop's website using React and a JSON mock server to store the data.
