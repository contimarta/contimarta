## About Me

My name is Marta, and I'm pursuing a career in software engineering. During my Physics degree I discovered my passion for coding, and after a few years in academic Philosophy, I realised that my enthusiasm for creative problem solving and my talent to handle complexity align perfectly with a software engineering career.

My focus now is to work on exciting projects and continue to grow as a developer. I'm currently developing both my front end and back end skills, working in several personal projects using React, JS, Express, MongoDB, and Java.

Here you can find some of my personal projects.

In my spare time I like to grow vegetables in my allotment 🌱, cook meals from scratch 🥘, and going to the cinema 🎥. I also enjoy running 🏃🏻‍♀️, playing tennis 🎾 and football⚽️!

## Projects

- [My Twitter Clone](https://github.com/contimarta/Twitter-clone) - Full stack project: Twitter App clone using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)  stack. Deployed with Render and Netlify [here](https://glittering-starship-2d6852.netlify.app/).
- [My Starling Bank App](https://github.com/contimarta/starling-bank-app) - In this project I created a Starling Bank App using Starling Bank's API and sandbox. The frontend uses React, and I also built an Express Server to avoid CORS errors.
- [The Guardian News App](https://github.com/contimarta/news-challenge) - Personal project where I built a React App that uses The Guardian API to retrieve the latest news and display them.
