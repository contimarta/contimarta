Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Marta, and I am eager to start a career in software engineering! During my Physics degree I discovered my passion for coding, and after a few years in academic Philosophy, I realised that my enthusiasm for creative problem solving and my talent to handle complexity align perfectly with a software engineering career. This led me to enrol in the Digital Futures Academy, where Iâ€™m improving my skills both in Front-End and Back-End development. The bootcamp features a diverse range of activities, including hands-on individual and team challenges, collaborative peer-review sessions, and workshops designed to improve my professional skills. Throughout the course, I am learning to apply Test-Driven Development, SOLID principles, and Agile practices to all aspects of the development process, as well as to work effectively as part of a team.

Here you can find some of my personal projects.

## Projects

- [The Guardian News App](https://github.com/contimarta/news-challenge) - Digital Futures challenge where I built a React App that uses The Guardian API to retrieve the latest news and display them.
