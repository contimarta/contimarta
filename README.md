## About Me

My name is Marta, and I'm pursuing a career in software engineering. During my Physics degree I discovered my passion for coding, and after a few years in academic Philosophy, I realised that my enthusiasm for creative problem solving and my talent to handle complexity align perfectly with a software engineering career.

My focus now is to work on exciting projects and continue to grow as a developer. I'm currently developing both my front end and back end skills, working in several personal projects using React, JavaScript, Golang, Java, Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB.

In my spare time I like to grow vegetables in my allotment 🌱, cook meals from scratch 🥘, and going to the cinema 🎥. I also enjoy running 🏃🏻‍♀️, playing tennis 🎾 and football⚽️!

Here, you can explore three personal projects I've recently completed:

## Projects

- [My Twitter Clone](https://github.com/contimarta/Twitter-clone) - Full Stack project: Twitter App clone using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack and JWT to authenticate users. The core features of Twitter are available. Users can register, log in, and log out. Once logged in, users can contribute to the platform by tweeting and posting comments to any published tweet. Unregistered users can see published tweets, but they cannot contribute. Deployed with Render and Netlify [here](https://glittering-starship-2d6852.netlify.app/) (please be patient as it may take a few minutes to show tweets).
- [User Management System](https://github.com/contimarta/UserManagementSystem_App) - Full Stack project: I have built a Fictional User Management System using Golang in the backend and React & Bootstrap in the frontend. The system allows managers to register and log in and uses JWT to authenticate API calls. The system stores information about users, including a pdf simulating a contract, and allows managers to edit user information, upload and download contracts, create new users, and delete users.
- [My Starling Bank App](https://github.com/contimarta/starling-bank-app) - In this project I created a Starling Bank App using Starling Bank's API and sandbox. The frontend uses React, and I also built a Middleware Express Server to allow CORS. To use it you need a sandbox account. The app allows users to: create a new savings goal, add money to savings goals, check their bank statement, and check their savings goals and how close they are to their target.
